# Canvas_Editor
It's an editor in which the user uses the canvas and selects from a menu objects and places them, with the possibility to drag and drop them around the canvas.

Features:
<pre>
-> Draw Shapes and drag and drop them
-> Erase all the shapes when clicking on the erase button
-> Erase individual shapes when dragging into the menu side
-> Sync colors based on shape ( when you select a new color, all the shapes that match the sync button for that shape will get that color, but the color which they had when they where first drawn is saved, so when you turn sync off, they will rever to original colors ).
</pre>
